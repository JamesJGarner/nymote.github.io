Building lightweight systems specifically geared to live on the cloud is not 
a trivial undertaking.  Even though it's possible to string together 
something quick with existing tools, they are ultimately limited since they 
lack the necessary security considerations.  To build scalable and 
distributed systems of this kind requires deep expertise in the areas of 
networking and the cloud as well as a commitment to Open Source software and community building.

The [software](../software) for [Nymote]({{site.production_url}}) comprises a number of related items that provide the core requirements of identity, connectivity and data storage.  The overall project is led by Anil Madhavapeddy, Jon Crowcroft and Amir Chaudhry and below is a list of the contributors so far.

<!-- Those are the people who understand what is practicable and how to sensibly construct, test and deploy such products. -->

### Contributors


<img style="float:left;" src="/images/anil.jpg">
**[Anil Madhavapeddy][anil-www]** is a Senior Research Fellow at the 
University of Cambridge, based in the Systems Research Group. He was on the 
original team that developed the Xen hypervisor, which powers much of the 
public cloud and also helped develop an industry-leading cloud management 
toolstack written entirely in OCaml. This XenServer product has been 
deployed on millions of physical hosts, and drives critical infrastructure 
for many Fortune 500 companies.

Prior to obtaining his PhD in 2006 from the University of Cambridge, Anil 
had a diverse background in industry at NetApp, NASA, and Internet Vision. 
He is an active member of the open-source development community with the 
OpenBSD operating system, is on the steering committee of the ACM Commercial 
Uses of Functional Programming workshop, and serves on the boards of startup 
companies.

**[Amir Chaudhry][amir-www]** is Programme Manager for OCaml Labs in the 
Systems Research Group at the University of Cambridge.  He has a remarkably 
broad academic background including work on detecting landmines, while at 
Imperial College and L'Universita di Padova.  He received his PhD in 2007 
from the University of Cambridge, while working on the
neuroscience of human emotion and decision-making.


Outside academia, Amir has been involved in several startups from medical 
devices to web applications and his roles have varied from that of early 
team member, to board level and post-acquisition integration. 
In 2009 he created and 
ran the initial Springboard accelerator programme, which recently merged 
with TechStars.  He has worked on special projects and product management 
at Red Gate Software, helping to take a long-established product from free 
to paid-for. Previously, he held a number of roles at National Grid plc.
