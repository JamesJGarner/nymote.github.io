Building lightweight systems specifically geared to live on the cloud is not 
a trivial undertaking.  Even though it's possible to string together 
something quick with existing tools, they are ultimately limited since they 
lack the necessary security considerations.  To build scalable and 
distributed systems of this kind requires deep expertise in the areas of 
networking and the cloud as well as a commitment to Open Source software and community building.

The [software](../software) for [Nymote]({{site.production_url}}) comprises 
a number of related items that provide the core requirements of identity, 
connectivity and data storage.  The overall project is led by Anil 
Madhavapeddy, Jon Crowcroft and Amir Chaudhry and below is a list of the 
contributors so far.

<!-- Those are the people who understand what is practicable and how to sensibly construct, test and deploy such products. -->
